            <h5>3.1 How to Initiate a Return</h5>
            To initiate a return, please follow these steps:<br>

            Contact our customer service team at tonnslegostore@shop.com or +9727684032 within 5 days of receiving your order.<br>
            Provide your order number and a brief description of the reason for the return.<br>
            Our team will review your request and provide you with a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and return instructions.
            <br>
            <h5>3.2 Shipping Your Return</h5>
            Pack the item securely in its original packaging, including all accessories, manuals, and documentation.<br>
            Clearly mark the RMA number on the outside of the package.<br>
            Ship the item to the address provided by our customer service team. We recommend using a trackable shipping service and purchasing shipping insurance, as we are not responsible for lost or damaged returns.
            <br>
            <h5>3.3 Return Shipping Costs</h5>
            If the return is due to our error (e.g., wrong item shipped, defective product), we will cover the return shipping costs.<br>
            For all other returns, the customer is responsible for the return shipping costs.
            <br><br>

            <h3>6. Late or Missing Refunds</h3>
            If you haven’t received a refund yet, please:<br>
